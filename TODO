TODO

 o Stylesheet width should be set by javascript, eliminating the need for having
   different stylesheets set manually for each counter.

 o The counter should not consist of a continuously updated string of HTML tags,
   with style="" attributes set differently for each iteration (as it is now) --
   but instead only the CSS should be dynamically updated.

 o XMLHttpRequests should be integrated into the objects

 o Isolation! Somehow, if one has several objects on the same HTML page, the
   different objects influence each other. -- Worked around this by using frames
   but that doesn't solve/explain the underlying problem (see examples in
   directory "two").
